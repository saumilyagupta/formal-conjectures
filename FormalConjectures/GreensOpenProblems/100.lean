# Green's Open Problem 100

*Reference:* [Green, Ben. "100 open problems." (2024).](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/greenbj/papers/open-problems.pdf#problem.100)

Is every group well-approximated by finite groups?

This problem asks whether every group is residually finite. A group is residually finite if
for every non-identity element, there exists a normal subgroup such that the quotient is finite
and the element is not contained in the normal subgroup.

Is every group well-approximated by finite groups?

Equivalently, is every group residually finite? A group $G$ is residually finite if for every
non-identity element $g \in G$, there exists a normal subgroup $N$ such that $G/N$ is finite
and $g \notin N$.

theorem green_100 :
  answer(sorry) ↔
    ∀ (G : Type*) [Group G],
      (∀ (g : G), g ≠ 1 → ∃ (N : Subgroup G), N.Normal ∧ Finite (G ⧸ N) ∧ g ∉ N) := by
